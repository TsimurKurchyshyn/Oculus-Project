---

A new modern styled website design with included adaptation for smaller screens such as phones and tablets. The website was made from a Youtube video but with included modifications. Some objects might look different or broken in smaller screens, please let me know below what should be fixed. For now, the project is fully finished.

**Non-Youtube added:** News section, Reviews section, Buttons in the header and footer that teleport to sections.
